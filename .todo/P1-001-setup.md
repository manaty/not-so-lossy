# Task: Initialize project with TypeScript template

## Overview
**Phase**: P1
**Category**: Setup
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: None
**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Completed | [ ] Blocked

## Description
Set up the initial TypeScript project structure with necessary dependencies for image processing, compression algorithms, and testing infrastructure. This will form the foundation for implementing the distributed lossy compression system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TypeScript project initialized with proper configuration
- [ ] Image processing libraries installed and configured
- [ ] Basic project structure established
- [ ] Development environment ready for algorithm implementation
- [ ] Build and test scripts functional

## Requirements
- Node.js and npm/yarn
- TypeScript 5.x
- Image processing capabilities (Sharp, Canvas, or similar)
- Testing framework (Jest or Vitest)
- Linting and formatting tools

## Implementation Steps
1. [ ] Initialize npm project with TypeScript
   - Create package.json
   - Install TypeScript and configure tsconfig.json
   - Set up build scripts

2. [ ] Set up project directory structure
   - src/ for source code
   - tests/ for test files
   - examples/ for sample images and demos
   - dist/ for compiled output

3. [ ] Install and configure image processing libraries
   - Evaluate options (Sharp, Jimp, Canvas)
   - Install chosen library with TypeScript types
   - Create basic image I/O utilities

4. [ ] Set up development tooling
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Add pre-commit hooks (Husky)
   - Set up nodemon for development

5. [ ] Create initial architecture modules
   - Core compression interface
   - Image analyzer module
   - Reconstruction module
   - Utility functions

6. [ ] Set up testing infrastructure
   - Install Jest/Vitest with TypeScript support
   - Configure test scripts
   - Create initial test structure

7. [ ] Add example images and basic scripts
   - Sample images for testing
   - Basic compression/decompression scripts
   - README updates with usage instructions

## Notes & Considerations
- Consider memory efficiency for large images
- Plan for different image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Design interfaces to support multiple compression strategies
- Think about metadata preservation for reconstruction

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows TypeScript best practices
- [ ] All dependencies have TypeScript types
- [ ] Build process is optimized
- [ ] Documentation is clear and complete

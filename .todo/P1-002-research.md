# Task: Literature review and algorithm design

## Overview
**Phase**: P1
**Category**: Research
**Priority**: High
**Dependencies**: P1-001-setup
**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Completed | [ ] Blocked

## Description
Research existing compression algorithms, focusing on JPEG as the primary candidate for adaptation. Design the distributed compression strategies that will allow different devices to preserve different aspects of the image.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive understanding of JPEG compression pipeline
- [ ] Identified multiple orthogonal compression strategies
- [ ] Designed recovery algorithm for combining multiple versions
- [ ] Documented mathematical foundation for the approach
- [ ] Created visual diagrams explaining the concept

## Requirements
- Understanding of DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)
- Knowledge of color space transformations (RGB to YCbCr)
- Familiarity with quantization matrices
- Linear algebra for reconstruction algorithms

## Implementation Steps
1. [ ] Study JPEG compression pipeline in detail
   - DCT transformation process
   - Quantization tables and their effects
   - Chroma subsampling strategies
   - Entropy coding basics

2. [ ] Identify distribution strategies
   - Frequency band preservation (low/mid/high)
   - Color channel prioritization (Y/Cb/Cr)
   - Spatial region emphasis
   - Quality factor variations

3. [ ] Design reconstruction algorithm
   - Weighted averaging approaches
   - Frequency domain combination
   - Missing data interpolation
   - Quality assessment metrics

4. [ ] Create proof-of-concept examples
   - Simple 8x8 block demonstrations
   - Visual examples of different strategies
   - Expected quality improvements

5. [ ] Document theoretical foundation
   - Mathematical formulation
   - Information theory perspective
   - Comparison with existing approaches

## Notes & Considerations
- JPEG is ideal because it already separates information into components
- DCT naturally provides frequency separation for distribution
- YCbCr color space allows independent channel processing
- Quantization tables can be strategically modified
- Consider progressive JPEG as inspiration

## Proposed Distribution Strategies
1. **Frequency-based**: Different devices preserve different DCT coefficient ranges
2. **Channel-based**: Devices prioritize Y, Cb, or Cr channels differently  
3. **Region-based**: Different spatial areas preserved at higher quality
4. **Hybrid**: Combinations of the above approaches

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Strategies are truly orthogonal (minimize overlap)
- [ ] Recovery algorithm is computationally feasible
- [ ] Approach offers measurable improvement over single compression
- [ ] Method is generalizable to other formats

# Distributed JPEG Compression Strategies

## Strategy 1: Frequency Band Distribution

### Concept
Divide the 64 DCT coefficients (8Ã—8) among different devices based on frequency ranges.

### Frequency Map (Zig-zag order):
```
 0  1  5  6 14 15 27 28
 2  4  7 13 16 26 29 42
 3  8 12 17 25 30 41 43
 9 11 18 24 31 40 44 53
10 19 23 32 39 45 52 54
20 22 33 38 46 51 55 60
21 34 37 47 50 56 59 61
35 36 48 49 57 58 62 63
```

### Device Distribution:
- **Device A (Low frequencies)**: Coefficients 0-15
  - Preserves general shapes, smooth gradients
  - Critical for image recognition
  
- **Device B (Mid frequencies)**: Coefficients 16-35
  - Preserves moderate details
  - Important for texture

- **Device C (High frequencies)**: Coefficients 36-63
  - Preserves fine details, edges
  - Important for sharpness

### Implementation:
```typescript
interface FrequencyStrategy {
  deviceId: string;
  coefficientRange: [number, number];
  quantizationScale: number;
}
```

## Strategy 2: Channel-Based Distribution

### Concept
Different devices prioritize different color channels with varying quality.

### Device Profiles:
- **Device A**: 
  - Y channel: Quality 90
  - Cb channel: Quality 30
  - Cr channel: Quality 30

- **Device B**:
  - Y channel: Quality 60
  - Cb channel: Quality 80
  - Cr channel: Quality 40

- **Device C**:
  - Y channel: Quality 60
  - Cb channel: Quality 40
  - Cr channel: Quality 80

### Benefits:
- Luminance preserved by Device A ensures recognizability
- Color information distributed between B and C
- Reconstruction combines best of each channel

## Strategy 3: Adaptive Quantization Distribution

### Concept
Each device uses different quantization matrices optimized for different content types.

### Quantization Profiles:

**Device A - "Smooth Preserving"**
```
8   6   5   8  12  20  26  31
6   6   7  10  13  29  30  28
7   7   8  12  20  29  35  28
7   9  11  15  26  44  40  31
9  11  19  28  34  55  52  39
12  18  28  32  41  52  57  46
25  32  39  44  52  61  60  51
36  46  48  49  56  50  52  50
```

**Device B - "Edge Preserving"**
```
16  11  10  16  24  40  51  61
12  12  14  19  26  58  60  55
14  13  16  24  40  57  69  56
14  17  22  29  51  87  80  62
18  22  37  56  68  25  30  40
24  35  55  64  81  30  35  45
49  64  78  87 103  40  45  50
72  92  95  98 112  45  50  55
```

## Strategy 4: Spatial Region Distribution

### Concept
Different devices compress different spatial regions with higher fidelity.

### Implementation Approaches:

1. **Center-Edge Distribution**:
   - Device A: High quality center, low quality edges
   - Device B: Low quality center, high quality edges
   - Device C: Uniform medium quality

2. **Quadrant Distribution**:
   - Device A: High quality top-left quadrant
   - Device B: High quality top-right quadrant
   - Device C: High quality bottom half

3. **Feature-Based Distribution**:
   - Use edge detection to identify regions
   - Distribute high-quality preservation based on features

## Strategy 5: Hybrid Approach

### Concept
Combine multiple strategies for optimal distribution.

### Example Configuration:
```typescript
interface HybridStrategy {
  device: string;
  frequency: {
    lowFreqBoost: number;
    midFreqBoost: number;
    highFreqBoost: number;
  };
  channels: {
    yQuality: number;
    cbQuality: number;
    crQuality: number;
  };
  spatial: {
    centerWeight: number;
    edgeWeight: number;
  };
}
```

### Device Configurations:
```typescript
const deviceA: HybridStrategy = {
  device: "A",
  frequency: { lowFreqBoost: 2.0, midFreqBoost: 1.0, highFreqBoost: 0.5 },
  channels: { yQuality: 90, cbQuality: 40, crQuality: 40 },
  spatial: { centerWeight: 1.5, edgeWeight: 0.8 }
};

const deviceB: HybridStrategy = {
  device: "B",
  frequency: { lowFreqBoost: 1.0, midFreqBoost: 2.0, highFreqBoost: 1.0 },
  channels: { yQuality: 70, cbQuality: 80, crQuality: 50 },
  spatial: { centerWeight: 1.0, edgeWeight: 1.0 }
};

const deviceC: HybridStrategy = {
  device: "C",
  frequency: { lowFreqBoost: 0.7, midFreqBoost: 1.0, highFreqBoost: 2.0 },
  channels: { yQuality: 70, cbQuality: 50, crQuality: 80 },
  spatial: { centerWeight: 0.8, edgeWeight: 1.5 }
};
```

## Recovery Algorithm Framework

### Basic Reconstruction:
```typescript
function reconstructImage(compressedVersions: CompressedImage[]): ReconstructedImage {
  // 1. Align all versions
  const aligned = alignBlocks(compressedVersions);
  
  // 2. For each 8x8 block
  for (const blockPos of imageBlocks) {
    // 3. Collect DCT coefficients from all versions
    const dctSets = collectDCTCoefficients(aligned, blockPos);
    
    // 4. Merge coefficients based on strategy
    const mergedDCT = mergeStrategies(dctSets);
    
    // 5. Inverse DCT
    const spatialBlock = inverseDCT(mergedDCT);
    
    // 6. Place in reconstructed image
    reconstructed.setBlock(blockPos, spatialBlock);
  }
  
  return reconstructed;
}
```

### Advanced Reconstruction:
1. **Confidence Weighting**: Weight contributions based on strategy strength
2. **Missing Data Interpolation**: Fill gaps when some frequencies are missing
3. **Artifact Reduction**: Post-process to reduce blocking artifacts
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Multiple passes to improve quality

## Evaluation Metrics

1. **PSNR** (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)
2. **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index)
3. **Frequency Coverage**: Percentage of frequencies preserved
4. **Perceptual Quality**: User studies
5. **Compression Ratio**: Total size vs single high-quality version
